## ⚙️ Pretrained Models & Fine-Tuning

This system leverages the power of pretrained models, each fine-tuned for its respective domain. With simple tweaks to the dataset, you can customize each model for your clinical-specific tasks.

### 📝 **1. BERT - Bio_ClinicalBERT (Text Data)**
- **Pretrained Model**: **Bio_ClinicalBERT** from **Hugging Face**.
- **Pretraining**: This model is pretrained specifically for **biomedical and clinical text** using PubMed abstracts and MIMIC-III clinical notes, making it highly adept at understanding medical terminology and clinical context.
- **Fine-Tuning for Clinical Tasks**: 
  - **Use Case**: Analyze clinical notes, patient history, and medical documentation for diagnosis or treatment recommendation.
  - **How to Fine-Tune**: Place your clinical notes in `/data/clinical_text/` in CSV format, and run the fine-tuning script to adapt the model to your specific needs.
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/VishShaji/ai-multimodal-diagnosis.git
  cd ai-multimodal-diagnosis
  mkdir -p data/clinical_text/
  # Add your clinical notes CSV files and start fine-tuning!
  python fine_tune_model.py --model BERT --data data/clinical_text/ --epochs 10
  ```

### 💓 **2. LSTM - ts2vec (Time-Series Data)**
- **Pretrained Model**: **ts2vec** (Time-Series to Vector) model.
- **Pretraining**: This LSTM-based model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies in **time-series data** like ECG signals, heart rate, and other patient vitals.
- **Fine-Tuning for Clinical Tasks**:
  - **Use Case**: Predicting anomalies in time-series data such as ECG or blood pressure trends.
  - **How to Fine-Tune**: Add your time-series data to `/data/time_series/` folder in `.csv` format, labeled with timestamps and the relevant patient vitals.
  
  ```bash
  mkdir -p data/time_series/
  # Place your time-series data in CSV format here
  python fine_tune_model.py --model LSTM --data data/time_series/ --epochs 10
  ```

### 🖼️ **3. CNN - CheXNet (Medical Imaging)**
- **Pretrained Model**: **CheXNet** (based on **DenseNet121**), pretrained for **chest X-ray classification**.
- **Pretraining**: CheXNet is pretrained on the **ChestX-ray14** dataset, where it learned to diagnose conditions such as pneumonia, lung masses, and edema with high accuracy.
- **Fine-Tuning for Clinical Tasks**: 
  - **Use Case**: Diagnostic classification on medical images like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs.
  - **How to Fine-Tune**: Place your medical images into the `/data/medical_images/` folder. Use labeled images to fine-tune the model for your specific diagnostic needs.
  
  ```bash
  mkdir -p data/medical_images/
  # Add your labeled medical images here for fine-tuning!
  python fine_tune_model.py --model CNN --data data/medical_images/ --epochs 10
  ```

### 🧠 **4. Vision Transformers (ViT) - ViT_Base_Patch16_224 (Advanced Medical Imaging)**
- **Pretrained Model**: **ViT_Base_Patch16_224** from **Hugging Face**.
- **Pretraining**: ViT is pretrained on **ImageNet** and uses a transformer architecture for high-resolution image processing. Unlike traditional CNNs, ViT captures global image features, making it highly effective for complex medical image analysis.
- **Fine-Tuning for Clinical Tasks**:
  - **Use Case**: Advanced medical image segmentation and classification tasks, such as tumor detection, organ segmentation, or retina scan analysis.
  - **How to Fine-Tune**: Add high-resolution medical scans to the `/data/medical_images/` directory. This model can process more intricate features in medical scans like MRIs or PET scans.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p data/medical_images/
  # Place high-resolution medical scans here for ViT training
  python fine_tune_model.py --model ViT --data data/medical_images/ --epochs 10
  ```

## 🚀 **How to Fine-Tune for Your Dataset**

**It’s easy to adapt this project to your specific clinical data**—whether it's clinical notes, time-series data, or medical images. Here’s how:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishShaji/ai-multimodal-diagnosis.git
   cd ai-multimodal-diagnosis
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Data**:
   - **Text Data**: Add clinical notes to `/data/clinical_text/` in CSV format.
   - **Time-Series Data**: Add patient vital time-series data (e.g., ECG, heart rate) to `/data/time_series/`.
   - **Image Data**: Add labeled medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) to `/data/medical_images/`.

3. **Fine-Tune the Model**:
   - Choose the model you want to fine-tune, whether BERT, LSTM, CNN, or ViT, and run the fine-tuning script with your new data.

   Example for BERT:
   ```bash
   python fine_tune_model.py --model BERT --data data/clinical_text/ --epochs 10
   ```

   Example for CheXNet:
   ```bash
   python fine_tune_model.py --model CNN --data data/medical_images/ --epochs 10
   ```
